## 🚀 How to use it

This repo is built around FPGA development skills. Each skill focuses on one part of the flow.

Use it like this:

1. Download the release from GitHub
2. Open the files in the release package
3. Read the skill that matches your task
4. Follow the steps in order
5. Move to the next skill after your current task is done

If you are new to FPGA work, start with the HLS skill. If you already have a design, jump to synthesis, constraints, or timing.

## 🧭 FPGA development flow

The project follows a common FPGA flow:

- HLS C/C++
- RTL design
- Synthesis
- Constraints
- Implementation
- Timing analysis
- Programming and debug

It also uses simulation and TCL automation across the flow.

## 📚 Skills included

### 🧱 vitis-hls-synthesis

This skill covers HLS synthesis in Vitis HLS.

Use it when you want to turn C/C++ into RTL. It helps with:

- Pragma use
- Interface setup
- Dataflow and pipeline design
- Burst transfer tuning
- Synthesis report reading

This skill is useful when you want better speed or lower resource use.

### ⚙️ vivado-synth

This skill covers synthesis in Vivado.

Use it when your design is ready for the next step. It helps with:

- Strategy choice
- RAM, DSP, and shift register use
- Resource inference
- FSM encoding
- Out-of-context synthesis
- Incremental synthesis

This skill helps you guide how Vivado builds your hardware design.

### 📐 vivado-constraints

This skill covers design constraints.

Use it to tell Vivado how your board and clock work. It helps with:

- Clock definition
- I/O delay settings
- Timing exceptions
- False paths
- Input and output timing setup

Good constraints help the tool understand your real hardware setup.

### ⏱️ timing-analysis

This skill covers timing checks after implementation.

Use it to see if your design can run at the target clock rate. It helps with:

- Setup and hold checks
- Slack review
- Critical path lookup
- Timing report reading
- Fixing slow paths

This step matters when a design works in simulation but fails in hardware.

### 🧰 rtl-design

This skill covers RTL design basics.

Use it when you write or review Verilog or VHDL. It helps with:

- Module structure
- Signal naming
- Register logic
- Combinational logic
- Clocked logic
- Clean code layout

This skill supports stable and readable hardware design.

### 🔬 sim

This skill covers simulation across the flow.

Use it to test your design before hardware use. It helps with:

- Testbench setup
- Waveform review
- Input and output checks
- Debugging logic errors
- Checking expected results

Simulation helps catch problems early.

### 🧪 tcl-automation

This skill covers TCL use across the flow.

Use it when you want repeatable steps in Vivado and Vitis. It helps with:

- Project setup
- Run control
- Report generation
- Batch tasks
- Tool automation

TCL is useful when you want the same steps each time.

### 🔧 programming-debug

This skill covers board programming and debug.

Use it after the design is built. It helps with:

- Bitstream loading
- Hardware testing
- Signal viewing
- Debug setup
- Problem tracing on the board

This is the last step before real hardware use.

## 🗂️ Skill list at a glance

| Skill | Main use | What it helps with |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| vitis-hls-synthesis | HLS build | C/C++ to RTL, pragmas, pipelines |
| vivado-synth | Logic synthesis | Strategy, resources, inference |
| vivado-constraints | Timing setup | Clocks, delays, exceptions |
| timing-analysis | Timing checks | Slack, paths, speed issues |
| rtl-design | HDL design | Verilog/VHDL structure |
| sim | Simulation | Testbenches, waveforms, checks |
| tcl-automation | Automation | Batch runs, reports, repeatable work |
| programming-debug | Hardware use | Bitstream, board test, debug |

## 🧩 How to choose the right skill

Use this simple guide:

- If you write C/C++ for hardware, start with **vitis-hls-synthesis**
- If you write Verilog or VHDL, start with **rtl-design**
- If your design builds but does not meet speed, use **timing-analysis**
- If the board does not behave as expected, use **sim** and **programming-debug**
- If you want repeatable setup, use **tcl-automation**

## 📁 Suggested folder setup

You can keep your files in a simple layout like this:

- `Downloads` for the release file
- `FPGA-Agent-skills` for the extracted project
